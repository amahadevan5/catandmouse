# catandmouse
2-player python game utilizing WASD and arrow keys as inputs to move 2 chartacters
At the beginning of the process, I coded the movements for a single character block. After this, I began to code the movements in for a separate character. This is the first part of this project that makes it distinctly different. I experienced some difficulties in finding where to insert the extra variables and block of code for the second character but eventually found places for them that streamlined the code. This part of my program was independently created. Another distinct portion was making the mouse bounce off the walls whenever it collided with them. This, along with the varying speeds of the characters is the part that differentiates them and makes the game winnable by wither character. This part was also developed independently.Â 			
The first part of this code has to do with the movements of the snake block. The four arrow keys move the snake block in the 4 directions at a constant speed. The next part of the algorithm involves the movements of the mouse block, which is controlled by a similar block of code that utilizes the WASD keys to move the character in the 4 directions at a constant speed that is slower than the snake. When used in tandem, the game can have 2 players, both of whom can win the game.
This abstraction that I developed allows the mouse block to bounce off the walls when it comes into contact with them. This is to give both characters only one way to win the game each. Part of this abstraction also helps the mouse block spawn at any random area within the confines of the window. Before this abstraction, the mouse block would spawn at random places, sometimes even outside the window, but it was fixed.
